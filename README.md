job-interviewer
I think every frontend developer (even at the junior level) has wondered at least once how to prepare for a job interview.

This is my small attempt to answer that question. And also my pet project based on Angular, Typescrypt and Ionic.
I have collected in the app the most common questions from the following categories:

 - Front-end developer interview questions,
 - Angular interview questions,
 - Interview answers for HTML and CSS questions.


I hope it will be helpful to someone else as well.
